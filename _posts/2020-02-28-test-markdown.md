This is a demo post to show you how to write blog posts with markdown.  I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](https://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.

Tags are an important part of many digital platforms, including YouTube, social media sites, and online forums. They help users find and organize content on the platform, and they help the platform's algorithm understand the content and make recommendations to users. In YouTube, tags can help users find videos on a specific topic, and they can help the platform recommend a video to users who are interested in that topic. Generally, tags help make digital platforms more useful and user-friendly by making it easier to find and organize content.
Unfortunately, every good tool is prone to abuse and misuse. The word “misuse” indicates that users use them in less relevant videos because they fail to grasp the true context of the tag; while “abuse” indicates how some users deliberately use popular tags in irrelevant videos for personal gains.  Miscategorizing videos by adding irrelevant tags is against the terms of services and is a direct violation in YouTube’s policy on misleading metadata. The abuse of tags has been a long-term concern in the community, in which Google has decided that the tags were made private from public pages to stop some users from “abusing tags by copying them from other videos” back in 2012. The question is: How critical was the misuse of tags back then? And are we able to detect a certain pattern of tags that are more prone to abuse and misuse? 

**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

![Crepe](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg)

It can also be centered!

![Crepe](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.
